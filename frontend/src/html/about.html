        <p>
          This project develops and deploys a static blog site through a secure,
          automated DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline. The team uses AWS Amplify for
          continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD),
          significantly simplifying the deployment process compared to the
          initially planned setup with AWS EC2, S3, and CloudFront. AWS Amplify
          manages both staging and production environments with minimal
          complexity, streamlining deployment without the need for manual
          workflow configurations via GitHub Actions.
          <br /><br />
          For version control and automated testing, GitHub is used, with GitHub
          Actions still handling unit and integration testing of both frontend
          and backend code. This includes tests involving a local MongoDB
          server, ensuring that code changes are thoroughly validated before
          deployment.
          <br /><br />
          Despite opting out of AWS security groups and IAM roles due to the
          steep learning curve and the team's limited experience in configuring
          these advanced security features, the project maintains a focus on
          secure development practices. Ryan, the team member responsible for
          AWS, ensures that all services function securely and efficiently,
          addressing security concerns in areas where deeper configuration isn't
          feasible.
          <br /><br />
          The project demonstrates secure development practices, tool
          comparisons between AWS, Azure, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions, as well
          as operational monitoring with AWS CloudWatch and GitHub Insights. It
          highlights the use of continuous integration and delivery workflows,
          security scanning, and deployment, showcasing a full end-to-end
          DevSecOps implementation behind the scenes.
